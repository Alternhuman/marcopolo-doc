   DHCPDISCOVER -  Client broadcast to locate available servers.

   DHCPOFFER    -  Server to client in response to DHCPDISCOVER with
                   offer of configuration parameters.

   DHCPREQUEST  -  Client message to servers either (a) requesting
                   offered parameters from one server and implicitly
                   declining offers from all others, (b) confirming
                   correctness of previously allocated address after,
                   e.g., system reboot, or (c) extending the lease on a
                   particular network address.

   DHCPACK      -  Server to client with configuration parameters,
                   including committed network address.

   DHCPNAK      -  Server to client indicating client's notion of network
                   address is incorrect (e.g., client has moved to new
                   subnet) or client's lease as expired

   DHCPDECLINE  -  Client to server indicating network address is already
                   in use.

   DHCPRELEASE  -  Client to server relinquishing network address and
                   cancelling remaining lease.

   DHCPINFORM   -  Client to server, asking only for local configuration
                   parameters; client already has externally configured
                   network address.
